# Predicting Tracts with Risk of High Eviction Rate in Virgina

## Overview
Breakdown of time periods for our training and testing sets can be found [here](./time_splits.csv). 

[Here](./features.txt) is our full list of generated features. 

TODO: Here is our list of feature importances. 

TODO: Here is the list of tracts generated by our best model. 


## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook, titled predicting_va_evictions.ipynb , walks through the process of loading the data, creating the features, selecting the models to run, and finally runnning the models. The notebook calls pipeline_evictions.py, which handles data loading, processing, feature generation, and creation of test/train datasets. It also calls ml_loop_evictions.py, which passes training and testing datasets through a given list of models. The iterate_over_models_and_training_sets() function returns a table with results across train test splits over time and performance metrics (baseline, precision and recall at different thresholds 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% and AUC_ROC).
